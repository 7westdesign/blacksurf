         <h1 class="marketing_header6">About Us</h1>
         <p class="topshow"><span class="lightp"> I started Pike Surf School so that I could pass my love and knowledge of surfing on to this generation and the next,</span> to anyone and everyone who is interested in learning.  My hope and dream is to inspire others, so they can connect with their sense of wonder and zest for life through surfing.  Over the years, I've given lessons to everyone from children, teens, and adults - and the one thing I've always found to be true is that having a good firsttime surfing experience is key. But there is also something that keeps us all coming back for more, the drive to be a surfer. I want to share that experience with you.
<h1 class="marketing_header7">Instructor Bio:</h1><div id="part4"></div>
<p class="topshow"><span class="lightp"> James Benjamin Pike,  born on July 11th ,1985, at the Children’s</span> Hospital in beautiful San Francisco, California.  When I came out of the womb, the doctor held me up by my feet,  looked me up and down, then handed me over to my Mother and said ” He’s going to be a skateboarder.” My Mother, in horror, covered my little ears and said ” Don’t say that!”.  The doctor replied, “Sorry, I’ve been doing this for a 40 years, I can just tell, Skater. ”   My parents were living in Fremont, California at the time, my  Mother was working at the Port of Oakland, as a Management Consultant, and it was easy for her to break away from work to cross over into San Francisco for doctor visits and eventually my birth.  My Dad was also a Management Consultant in Silicon Valley.   My Mom left her employment at the Port of Oakland and stayed home with me until the age of six-years old. <br /> <br /> <span class="lightp"> In 1992, she decided to return to her original profession:  University Associate Professor. She</span> was offered a teaching positions at the Madison University in Virginia, teaching in the Psychology, Sociology, Business & Gerontology Departments.  She also taught Sociology at Bridgewater College in Virginia.  We lived on a beautiful four seasons ski resort called Massanutten, so naturally, skiing become a passion of mine, especially night skiing with all the awesome lights at Massanutten! <br /> <br /><span class="lightp">  Living in Virginia with my Stepfather(Ben) taught my Mother and I  how to fish, hunt with a </span>bow, a high-powered deer rifle and pasted the knowledge and enthusiasm for the wildreness.  He showed us all of his favorite spots, on the rivers by canoe and  the mountains in his red chevy jimmy blazer.   We lived in Virginia for 7 years enjoying the changing of the seasons, the Blue Ridge Mountains and the warm southern hospitality.  We built a wonderful cabin (Bolar,VA) in a remote valley in NW Virginia, about 4 hours away from where we lived at the time.  <br /> <br /><span class="lightp">  Hunting and fishing on the weekend at the cabin with my family, the whole experience of the</span> road trip over three mountains and three rivers into our small hidden valley in the wilderness was priceless each time.  The escape to the woods was something that kept our family going, it was the fresh spring that replenished our dry out hearts, worn down for weeks of work and school.  I would find myself in the mountains for hours, fishing small remote streams,rivers and lake. Learning to  hunt from Ben and even leaving for over night trips into the mountains by myself  at 8 years old with a walkie talkie connected to the cabin, my two dogs and a 22 caliber rifle. <br /><br />In the summer time I would visit my Father in the Bay Area in California. My Father was in the US Army for 20 years as an Air Ranger, serving three tours in Vietnam and taught at West Point in the Military Psychology and Leadership department.  His passions in life are studying Native American Art, Archaeology and Sculpture.  He is a true Ceramic Archaeologist who studies myths and cultures from all over the world, he love’s to understand the mind of our ancients ancestors.  My father would plan out long trips with the wonderful theme of nature and discovery.  One of my favorite journeys into the unknown was when we would go to the Southwest looking for Native American rock art (petroglyph and pictograph). <br /><br />  In the deserts, canyons and valleys, it was alway an adventure from beginning to end because he loved exploring and learning the history of the amazing National Parks in the four corners region(Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado). When we would come back from these trip the first thing we would do is a road trip to Santa Cruz, to the Beach Boardwalk and afterwards to the coastline north of Santa Cruz, with a stop at a Historic restaurant and bar, known for its artichoke soup and seafood (Duarte’s Tavern in Pescadero) then all the way to Half Moon Bay.  These pilgrimages to Santa Cruz where a ritual in our family.  I remember swimming in the ocean in speedos because its all I had, I would swim all summer at the Santa Clara Olympic size swimming pool where everyone wore speedos, I had no boardshorts and no wetsuit, just a boogie board.  The water felt freezing and there was always a guy renting out wetsuits on the beach at the boardwalk.  The wetsuits looked magical like they where glowing a golden color and smelled wonderful, like new shoes in the heat.  I never got to rent one, they were $20 for two hour and my Dad wanted me to be tough, but always day dreamed of owning my own O’neill wetsuit someday and being able to go in the ocean all the time, warm and toasty. In 1999, my grandmother, who lived in Pacific Grove, California became very  ill.  As a result,  my Mother and I decided to leave Virginia and return back to California, to be with my Grandmother.  When my grandmother became well enough to be on her own again, we decided we should not return to Virginia. My Step Father stayed in Virginia, claiming to never leave Bath county, stayed close to his beloved wilderness.<br /><br /> 

That very summer when visiting my Father and my Stepmother(Brenda), we visited Santa Barbara on a over night trip to meet some of his ceramic artist friends. The people we visited lived only steps away from Santa Barbara Point and the Harbor.  After looking out into the Santa Barbara Channel for the first time on a crystal clear day, with all of  the Channel Islands and the Santa Barbara harbor with all of time beautiful boats and yachts and the awesome mountains in the background, it was almost too much to take in!  A thought shot through in my brain, like a air bubble rising from deep dark water to the surface of the sunny ocean  ” this is the most beautiful place I have ever seen.” When I got back to Pacific Grove, where my Mother had staying with my Grandmother,  I sold her on the idea that we needed to move down south, to sunny Santa Barbara, where it’s warmer and there would be more opportunities than Pacific Grove. My Mom and I decided to check it out and as soon as we did, we knew this was the place where we wanted to stay! We were so pumped up and excited for a new start, the California dream seem to be an endless summer.<br /><br /> 
My Mom found a place to live right by the beach in a small gated community across the street from the ocean called east beach. I was fresh off the airplane from Virginia with southern accent, wear total camo, feeling like I was from another planet.  I found the local surf shops and got my mom to buy for my birthday body board with bag and a new o’neill wetsuit, I was pumped up! With the keys to the kingdom I rode my bike with my body board on my back to surf spots called Sandspit and Leadbetter for two months, everyday. Then one day when walking up the cliff at Leadbetter, my whole world change like a supernova. As I was walking up the cliff, a surfer stopped me and stood in my way. He looked at me with a smile and asked me a simple question, “Do you surf?”, I replied, “No, I only Boogie Board!”, he laugh at me and smiled again. He looked me up and down then said ” doesn’t matter, come to my surf club meet tonight at the Shoreline Cafe.” He then pointed at the cafe in the distance and said, ” it’s right there, I’ll see you at 7pm”, then walked pasted me. I rode my bike home as fast as I could, I had a surf club meeting to attend.<br /><br /> 
That night my Mom drove me to the Shoreline Cafe to the meeting, it was a group of people I wasn’t use to being around. These guys were wearing saddles, hawaiian t-shirts and had leather faces, they looked nothing like the men I had been around in Virginia. The club meeting was a loose program based around pizza and the surf movie. The room would be loud and wild, then the surf movie would come one and the group would get quite then go nuts when the movie showed a big wipeout or impossible move made. The feeling and vibe was so friendly and everyone was happy to be there to talk about the up coming winter waves. The question was asked again to me, ” Do you surf?”, I said, “no, only boogie board.”. Everyone at the meeting kept saying, ” don’t worry about it, your going to surf”. I felt like they weren’t listing but I didn’t understand the feeling of standing up on the board.  The next day, the surfer I meet on the cliff, “JR” called me up and told me to meet him at the Beach House Surf Shop. I raced down there with my Mom to the surf shop to find JR in the used board room in the very back of the shop. He picked out a 9’8ft White Owl (one of the first surf brands in Santa Barbara, dating back to the 1950′s), the surf board was so old that the fin on it was off placed, meaning it wasn’t in the center, so it would turn fast to the right than the left. The surfboard shapers of the past thought that if you put the fin in the center of the board, on the wooden stringer( the dead center of the surfboard long ways, made of wood) it could break the board if the fin was damaged.<br /><br /> Through trial and error, the surfers at the time (1950′s) learned that it did the oppsite of was they thought, it made the board stronger and ride starighter. Not only was this board an anqtic but it was used as a target backboard for a BB gun.  It was $130, my Mom got it and JR show me how to do the ding repair on the bottom of the board to fill all the BB gun holes. After sanding down the dings on the bottom of the board, JR drew me a map to two surf spots, Monds Beach and Campus Point. The maps where two pieces of white 8 x 10 paper, he drew the surf spot out with black marker, taking up the whole page to draw the surf spot from an overview then writing directions and name of the spot at the bottom. That same day, my Mom drove out to Campus Point on a beautiful August day. She help me carry the 80 pound board to the beach, I opened a fresh bar of cold water surf board wax called SexWax. The smell was so intoxicating, it smelled like hot bubble gum, I paddle out the board in board shorts. <br /><br /> I paddle out far up to the top of the point and turned the board around and caught the first wave I paddled for, I stood up and remember thinking, Wow! This is way better than boogie boarding!” I rode that wave all the way down the point. I was hooked, I had my Mom drop me off everyday the rest of the summer of Campus Point at 7am to 8pm. School started and I wanted to keep surfing, My Mom found a private school that had a surfing class and was located in Downtown Santa Barbara called Ancapa. The school was insane and offered 2 big school trips to Big Sur and Yosemite and having a surf class that you got to leave school after lunch three days a week to go surf with the head master of the school. This introduce me to the coastline in Santa Barbara and all the way down to Oxnard Shores. The school was only 60 people and I wanted a big bowl to swim in, so the next year I decided to go to public school and enjoy being a kid.
 
 
 <br /><br /> 
I worked with the Santa Barbara Seals Surf School teaching surf lessons, coaching the after-school programs and running traveling summer camps.  I enjoy the experience of giving to gift of surfing to kids and adults. Living at Rincon Point with no car, I skateboarded everywhere! My first skateboard experience are skating inside the Rincon Colony.  I learned to do a skate trick called “a Bert” across the street from my house on a fairly steep driveway.  The trick is a surf inspired move named after Larry Bertlemann, aka “Rubberman”; he is an icon for surfing and skateboarding from the 70’s and 80′s to today. Larry help influence surfers and skaters in the Dogtown region  (Venice Beach, California) to create a whole new way of looking at skateboarding.  Style in surfing and skateboarding is as important as an artist flare for creativity. Just as every wave is different, so is the same to be said about people and the uniqueness of each person.  Rincon is what gave me style or flowing down the line approach to a wave or at a skatepark and Rincon is where I caught my first really rides inside the tube of the wave in the Cove.  Over those next three years I surfed and skated as much as I could and graduated from Carpinteria High School with a 3.0 GPA at 17 years old. After High School at 17 years old I decided to open my horizons, traveling to Baja, down to Scorpion Bay for about a month in September, 2003.  The surfing trip really opened my eyes up to what was important in my life, surfing, skating, family and friends.  After coming back to Santa Barbara, I worked with the Santa Barbara Seals Surf School teaching surf lessons, coaching the after-school programs and running traveling summer camps. <br /> <br />  I enjoy the experience of giving to gift of surfing to kids and adults. After taking a class at Santa Barbara City College on the Chumash Indains ( the Native American of  the Santa Barbara Area) showed me all the rich history about Santa Barbara and the Channel Islands.  This class made me want to explore more about Native American Culture and Archeology, so in following my passions for surfing, skateboarding and now Archeology,  I moved to Santa Cruz County and studied Philosophy, Ceramics and Native American studies at Cabrillo Community College in Aptos. Living in Santa Cruz county was an empowering experience; it has a lot to offer, in art and with tons of world-class skateparks and surf spots.  I continued my travels up to Portland, Oregon, which is still the coolest and weirdest city I have ever been too. <br /> <br /> In the Pacific Northwest, when I wanted to surf, I would drive to the Oregon Coastline to Pacific City or Seaside.  Other times, I would drive down through the night to Santa Cruz or Santa Barbara to intercept a big or small winter and summer swell.  In the summertime Portland is a another world with thick green forests and a cornucopia of world-class skateparks ( over 250 world class skateparks).  In just the first three years of being in Portland, I witnessed ten skateparks be built in the Greater Portland Area!  I skated all of them on their opening days and still have a passion for searching out the newest skateparks in the Pacific Northwest in the summertime! After 4 years in Portland, I decide that the most important objective at that point in my life was to live by the ocean and soak up sunshine on the beach at Rincon.   After being away from the sunshine and ocean blue waters, I realized how important it is, to be by the ocean and how healing it was for me. Moving back to Santa Cruz again, surfed and skated every chance I had.  I loved living to the Monterey Bay but I needed to get back to my roots and live closer to my Mom.  So I moved back to Santa Barbara to start a surfing & skateboarding skool dedicated to teaching surfing & skateboarding lessons and working with the kids in the local community to create world-class athletes!!! I started Pike’s Surf Academy so that I could pass my love and knowledge of surfing on to the next generation.  My hope and dream is to inspire others, so they can connect with their sense of wonder and zest for life!
