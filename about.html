         <h1 class="marketing_header6">About Us</h1>
         <p class="topshow"><span class="lightp"> I started Pike Surf Academy so that I could pass my love and knowledge of surfing on to this generation and the next,</span><span class="brightp"> to anyone and everyone who is interested in learning.  My hope and dream is to inspire others, so they can connect with their sense of wonder and zest for life through surfing.  Pike Surf Academy offers the safest, friendliest, and most fun surf lessons in Santa Barbara. Lessons are offered to anyone of any age who is interested in learning how to surf or wants to become more experienced. Individual lessons are 2 hours long and take place at a calm and friendly surfing beach just a short distance (10 minutes) on the southern end of Santa Barbara, CA and in at the end of 41st St near Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz, CA.</span>
<h1 class="marketing_header7">Instructor Bio:</h1><div id="part4"></div>
<p class="topshow"><span class="lightp">My journey in surfing began when my mom decided to move to California in 1999 from living in Harrisonburg, Virginia on a four season ski resort called Massanutten for seven years. My story is the story of the California dream and wanting more for my mom and my future. When my mom and I first moved to California, we lived in Pacific Grove on the Monterey Peninsula near my grandmother. Soon enough, I quickly convinced my Mother to move down to Santa Barbara, California because I knew that was where I wanted to live ever since I'd been down there to visit with my dad and hang out with some of his art friends. After experiencing the beautiful weather of Santa Barbara, I knew that was where I wanted to start my new life with my mother. <br /> <br />

Once we got down to Santa Barbara, I convinced my mom at 12 years old to get an apartment across from the ocean near downtown Santa Barbara and that's when everything changed for me. I started going down to the beach everyday to body surf. Shortly thereafter, I was invited to go to a surf club meeting at the shoreline cafe by Leadbetter beach in Santa Barbara. After that first surf club meeting I started surfing every single day after that from sun-up to su-down. I went to a private school in downtown Santa Barbara called Anacapa, they had an afterschool surf program where we would go surfing three times a week and get to leave right after lunch and go surfing with the headmaster, wherever we could convince him where the best waves were. It was a great way to get to know the area and hang out with some older surfers and get some great mentorship. I loved surfing so much because it just seemed like it was the perfect sport for me from the start: An soulful sport in the ocean that just allowed you to be present and connect with the ocean, absolutely perfect for somebody who loves the water and always felt grounded in it. <br /> <br />

After a year of living in a cramped one bedroom apartment, I searched all the rental listings that I could and found a house to live on Rincon Point in Carpinteria, California. All of a sudden it was showtime, time to surf! Surfing all day and surfing all night, surfing up to eight times in one day and surfing sometimes three times in one night during full moon and always surfing before school and afterschool no matter what the surf conditions were, big or small waves. It was absolutely the dream for me and going to Carpinteria high school, I got to know the local boys and surfed epic days with the local Rincon Point community. Surfing Rincon Point changed the way that I looked at surfing forever. From being influenced by Tom Curran, Joe Curran, Bobby Martinez, Kelly Slater and Dean Reynolds. I knew that I would want to surf like them and have a fast, down the line style that encompassed flow and intuition with perfect echnique. Rincon is not just only about hotdogging on a shortboard but also epicenter for longboarding in California and maybe even the world, specifically the inside break at Rincon called the Cove. I lived on Rincon Point for three years and every single day I pretended like it was the last day that I was ever going to be there because it was just so magical for me, I wanted to live life to the fullest. Rincon influenced my skateboarding and adjusted my perspective of the way that I wanted to live the rest of my life. <br /> <br />

I wanted to invest my time in looking for perfection of surf and basically trying to find a vision of perfection in waves. I dedicated the next 10 years of my life to pursuing surfing and skateboarding and along the way worked for the Santa Barbara Seals Surf School teaching surf lessons (start teaching surf lessons at 13 years old), coached the Coffin brothers, helped to run and direct the Billabong summer travel surf camp and eventually starting my own surf academy and my own skate camps. <br /> <br />

Living the California dream has been so amazing, I feel like every single day that I have been in California from the very first day my mother and I moved back to California has been like a endless summer vacation. So I literally feel like I have been on summer vacation for almost 15 years now! Surfing is the true fountain of youth because it makes you want to take care of your body and mind so you can keep pushing yourself to have more wonderful ocean experiences and live life to the fullest. My mother and I are a true testament to the California dream, that if you want it, you can make it here in the state of California and live life to the fullest by enjoying your surroundings and loving every moment of every day.
